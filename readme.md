# Farmania (CSC395)

Farmania is a project created as part of a four-person team as part of Canisius University (then College)'s CSC 395 Java course. The app is a fully-functional farming simulation game which features time-based farming mechanics with random disasters designed to mirror those of modern farming (fire, insects, ...) as well as an embedded shop that allows farmers
to sell their harvests for additional resources to further expand their farms (tractors, barns, seeds, ponds, etc.).
